Dear Final, your chances to die on our trip are 63.1%.
Gemini tip Mr. Final, a venerable gentleman of seventy-eight years, carries with him the quiet dignity of a lifetime well-lived. One can almost see the stories etched into his eyes, a testament to adventures past, as he now embarks upon what might be considered his grandest voyage across the Atlantic.

He would do well to find solace and warmth in the grand saloon, perhaps with a good book and a cup of tea, or to simply watch the endless horizon from a comfortable spot on the enclosed promenade deck, letting the gentle roll of the ship soothe his journey.

Though the icy embrace of the ocean awaits, one might wager that this seasoned soul, whose very name suggests an ultimate resolution, possesses a quiet resilience that could defy the odds and guide him through even the most treacherous of nights..
Enjoy your trip â˜º
